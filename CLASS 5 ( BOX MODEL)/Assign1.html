<!-- Please NOTE that the link to assets (like images) need to be set in global context.
For example:
To access an image from assets folder correct way to set src attribute is 

src = 'profile.png'

instead of 

src = './assets/profile.png'
-->

<!--The goal of this problem is to use CSS selectors to style a webpage.

Use relevant CSS selectors and properties to:
1. Change color of h1 heading to 'blue' and center it horizontally to the page.
2. Change background color <p> with class 'highlight' to 'yellow'.
3. Change font size of <p> with id 'special' to 20 pixels.
4. Add a solid gray border of 10 pixels to input of having type of 'text'.
5. Change the color of <a> to 'red' when user hovers over it.
